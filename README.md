# Python Class Example: Social Media User Following System
This repository demonstrates the use of Python classes and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts through a simple example of a social media-style following system.

## Overview
The program defines a User class with attributes and methods to simulate the functionality of following users. Each User object tracks the number of followers and the number of people they are following.

### Key Features
1. Class Attributes
- id: A unique identifier for the user.
- username: The username of the user.
- followers: Tracks how many users are following the user.
- following: Tracks how many users the user is following. 
2. Class Methods
- follow(user): Allows one user to follow another, incrementing the respective followers and following counts.

## Concept Demonstrated:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Class attributes and methods
- Interaction between class instances
This code serves as an excellent starting point for understanding OOP principles and can be extended further for more complex scenarios.
